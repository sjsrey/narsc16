    "This notebook covers a brief and gentle introduction to spatial econometrics in Python. To do that, we will use a set of Austin properties listed in AirBnb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of spatial econometrics is to introduce a formal representation of space into the statistical framework for regression. This can be done in many ways: by including predictors based on space (e.g. distance to relevant features), by splitting the datasets into subsets that map into different geographical regions (e.g. [spatial regimes](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/spreg/regimes.html)), by exploiting close distance to other observations to borrow information in the estimation (e.g. [kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)), or by introducing variables that put in relation their value at a given location with those in nearby locations, to give a few examples. Some of these approaches can be implemented with standard non-spatial techniques, while others require bespoke models that can deal with the issues introduced. In this short tutorial, we will focus on the latter group. In particular, we will introduce some of the most commonly used methods in the field of spatial econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we will use to demonstrate this draws on hedonic house price modelling. This a well-established methodology that was developed by [Rosen (1974)](https://www.sonoma.edu/users/c/cuellar/econ421/rosen-hedonic.pdf) that is capable of recovering the marginal willingness to pay for goods or services that are not traded in the market. In other words, this allows us to put an implicit price on things such as living close to a park or in a neighborhood with good quality of air. In addition, since hedonic models are based on linear regression, the technique can also be used to obtain predictions of house prices."

This will allow us, on the one hand, set the main principles of hedonic modeling and how to interpret the coefficients, which is good because the spatial models will build on this; and, on the other hand, it will provide a baseline model that we can use to evaluate how meaningful the spatial extensions are.\n",

These are a series of statistics that test whether the residuals of the regression are spatially correlated, against the null of a random distribution over space. If the latter is rejected a key assumption of OLS, independently distributed error terms, is violated. Depending on the structure of the spatial pattern, different strategies have been defined within the spatial econometrics literature to deal with them. If you are interested in this, a very recent and good resource to check out is [Anselin & Rey (2015)](https://geodacenter.asu.edu/category/access/public/spatial-regress). The main summary from the diagnostics for spatial dependence is that there is clear evidence to reject the null of spatial randomness in the residuals, hence an explicitly spatial approach is warranted."
